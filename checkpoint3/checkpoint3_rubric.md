# Rubric for Checkpoint 3

Checkpoint 3 is an early draft of your final results. This is *just* a presentation.  Your goal is to explain what you've done, what roadblocks (if any) you've faced, how to address them, and next steps.  This is your opportunity to get feedback from me.

# Presentations

Your presentation will have 7-8 slides, as follows:

1. **Title** A title slide with the names of all team members.  Please introduce yourselves during the presentation.
2. **Problem & Stakeholder** This slide will offer a succinct description of the domain problem, as we  as your primary stakeholder.
3. **Envisioned Solution** This is what you propose to do, and how this connects to your stakeholder need.
4. **Data** This slide should tell us about the data you are using; we just need general info, but this should help us understand roughly what's in your data, and how much of it there is.
5. **Initial Reults (1 or 2 slides)** These slides will tell us where you are with things.  Your results at this point should be _ok_ but not necessarily great. 
6. **Challenges** This slide will tell us about challenges you have encountered.  These may be challenges you have already addressed, but will certainly include challenges you are currently facing.
7. **Plan & Goals** This will summarize where you are planning to go with things from where you are now, and what your final deliverable will look like.
